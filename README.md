#  Using Vanilla JavaScript

The user's to-do list is stored in the local storage, so when he refreshes the page, he can always find the list there.

There is the possibility for the user, to clear the list, by clicking the button clear, at the top right corner of our app.

The to do list app, shows the today's date to the user, for that we're using a method called toLocaleDateString, which you can read about here:

We also used the **Font Awesome** libray check it out here:

 We will be improving onto this concept with more animations as well more features.
